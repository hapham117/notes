Itsy bitsy spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climed up the spout again
The itsy bitsy spider climed down to my head
Along cane the wind and blew him to a shed
The pigssaid oh no you don't belong in here
And the itsy bitsy spider cried alittle tear
The itsy bitsy spider went searching for a home
He was very sad and felt all alone
Along came the wind and blew him near the hens
And the itsy bitsy spider made some new friends
